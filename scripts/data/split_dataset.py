    Split the DigiForests dataset into train, validation, test, and prediction sets.

    This function organizes the DigiForests dataset into predefined splits based on
    experiment folders. It generates a JSON file containing file paths and statistics
    for each split.

    \n\n**Args:**\n
    - `raw_folder`: Root directory of the DigiForests dataset containing experiment folders.\n
    - `output_fp`: Custom path to save the output JSON file. If None, saves to raw_folder/data_split.json.

    \n\n**Splits:**\n
    - Train: Primary training data from multiple seasons.\n
    - Validation: Held-out data for model tuning.\n
    - Test: Unseen data for final model evaluation.\n
    - Prediction: Specific subset (Spring 2023) for inference tasks.

    \n\n**Output JSON Structure:**\n
    - File counts for each split\n
    - Train/Val ratios\n
    - File paths for each split\n
    - Combined trainval set

    \n\n**Note:**\n
    - Split ratios are calculated based on train and validation sets only.\n
    - The function assumes a specific folder structure within the raw_folder.
